# Unity-Jumping-Games
I have created Two games named Flarpy Bird and Super Capsule.
I have created these using C# Language with the help of Unity Platform.
These are Small User Responsive Games.
Flarpy Bird is a game where a bird must ensure to fly between the Pipes without touching them. If the bird touches the Pipe, the game ends there.
Capsule Collector is a game similar to Flarpy Bird. I have placed the coins on TailGrass, when collected increases the Jump Power rather than collecting the coins. Thought of impalmenting this as this was a unique idea.
